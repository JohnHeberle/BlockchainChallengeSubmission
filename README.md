The team submitted an application to store and track student tickets for football games on the blockchain. Within this repository is the application for a student to have their ticket authenticated (MobileUser) and the authentication application (AuthenticatorUser). Along with these two applications the team also submitted a web application connected to the EOS blockchain allowing for a ticket marketplace. The team came in second at the Block.One "Blockchain Challenge" wining an 8,000 dollar prize.
